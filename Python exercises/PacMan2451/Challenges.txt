Hello again! 
Exercise 2451 from the beecrowd website

Challenges:
-The code took me about 5-6 hours
-At first I had difficulties understanding how to create the square matrix, but more specifically how pacman traverses it.
This is because I hadn't been programming in python for a long time and some concepts such as arrays and the way to go through them had to be reviewed again.
Leaving this aside, the code can be done in a few lines, but if you want to introduce more "security" and stability in the inputs, it takes a little more time and code.
You can see my other way of approaching the code with functions in python and with another way of approaching the inputs in the file called PacMan2451EXTENDED
