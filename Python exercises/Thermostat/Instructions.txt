Problem - 1759C - Codeforces

In the exercise we are given the variables:
L,r,x  where L,r are the range of temperature and 
x is the minimum temperature change 
a,b -->(initial temperature, final temperature)

We need to find the minimum number of operations required 
to get temperature b from temperature a, or say that it is impossible

The inputs are as follows:
10
3 5 6 
3 3

Note: 
10 --> t Test cases
3 5 6 --> l,r,x
3 3 --> a,b

The output should be like this:
0 
2
3
-1
1
-1
3
1
3
-1
