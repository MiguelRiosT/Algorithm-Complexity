Hello again!

In the instructions it is shown how the output of the code should be:
0 
2
3
-1
1
-1
3
1
3
-1

The main challenge was figuring out
why and when to throw a 0, 1, 2, 3 or -1
Here the explain:
0 --> is when a == b, which means that the thermostat is already set correctly.

1 -->

2 -->

3 -->

-1 --> When it is impossible to obtain the temperature in any of the above ways
