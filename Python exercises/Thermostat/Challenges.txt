Hello again! - Here are the challenges!       

In the instructions it is shown how the output of the code should be:
0 
2
3
-1
1
-1
3
1
3
-1

The main challenge was figuring out
why and when to throw a 0, 1, 2, 3 or -1
Here the explain:
0 --> is when a == b, which means that the thermostat is already set correctly.

1 --> How did I deduce that the thermostat only needed one operation?
Analyze test cases 5 and 8 that present this output and using this |a−b| ≥ x L ≤ b ≤ r 
By substituting the values ​​we observe that |a−b| ≥ x is always true

2 -->
If we subtract the maximum temperature between a and b from the maximum range (r) a
nd this value is greater than or equal to the minimum value x 
we ​​will have an output of 2
Otherwise, if this is not true, we use OR to do the same, only now with the minimum values ​​instead of the maximum.
Here the equations to evaluate:
r-max(a,b)>=x OR l-min(a,b)>=x

If you have any doubts about this process, you can look in the Thermostat folder of my repository

3 -->



-1 --> When it is impossible to obtain the temperature in any of the above ways
Note for -1:
If you considered the option of defining -1 with the following equation only |a−b| ≥ x
Let me tell you that I also considered it but found that in the test cases with output 2,3
the equation |a−b| ≥ x presents the same result booleand that is FALSE
For this reason if we use only |a−b| ≥ x to define output -1 we will have inconsistencies with outputs 2 and 3


Important to always keep in mind to evaluate if the value is greater than or equal to x
