Hello again! 
Exercise 1163 from the beecrowd website


-The code took me about 4-5 hours
The main challenge is to know how to calculate the distance

In my repo I have three version of this code:
This is because I wanted to try to make the code with the math(AngryDucks1163) library and without it(AngryDucks1163WithoutMath)
-But for both codes the challenge is to achieve very precise values

The code that was accepted by beecrowd was AngryDucksACCEPTED
This is because we use very precise indications and the math library
